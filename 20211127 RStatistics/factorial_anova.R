### factorial anova
# 1. main effect: test significant differences btwn means, when grouped by each independent variable;

    # seeming like anova of "pivot table" data;

    # H0: groups means are equal;

# 2. interaction: test if mean difference is constant across all levels of the independent variable combinations;

# how: factorial_anova = "signal" / "noise";

# F tests;

# caution(as always): sample size and balanced design!

### correlation btwn factors
# balanced: no correlation;
# unbalanced: some correlation;
