# point-free programming

`point-free` refers to the intermediate states data
can be in when computing sequence of tramsformation;

`points` refers to are the states the data are in
after each tramsformation;

`point-free` means we do not focus on these points in any way;

sounds like `pipeline`

# composite

```{r}

h <- function(x) g(f(x))

# or
h <- function(x) {
    y <- f(x)
    g(y)
}

composite <- function(f, g) function(...) g(f())

f <- function(x) x * 2
g <- function(...) sum(...)
c <- composite(f, g)

c(1:3) # 12

```

# magrittr operator %>%

verb(subject, operation)

subject %>% operation
