# multivariate statistics
# hotelling T2 test
# purpose: test statistic simply based on "Mahalanobis distance" btwn two sample means;

# T^2 = (n1 * n2)/n * mahalanobis
# S = ((n1-1)S1 + (n2-1)S2)/(n1+n2-2)
# S: pooled_cov

# T-sq is similar to t.test(data);

# t.test(): test difference of means
# levene.test(): test equality of variances
# box's M.test(): test equality of covariance
